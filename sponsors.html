      <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code will pay the selected students 1500 USD per month for a three months period, so they can dedicate themselves to their Open Source projects full-time. As a sponsor, you will be crucial to make that happen.</p>
      <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code is all about the community. You will support it as a global project, so your sponsorship will enter a budget pool from which the selected students will be paid.</p>
      <p>If you are willing to support us, here is what we offer:</p>

      {% include sponsor_packages.html %}

      <p>You can also contribute a <strong>custom amount</strong> through <a href="/campaign">our crowdfunding</a> campaign and be listed on our website.</p>

      <p>Logos and links on the website will be sorted by amount and date. Please read the information on VAT and tax deductibility in the FAQ if you are contributing from within the EU and especially from Germany.</p>

      <p>We are also continuously working on additional ideas that haven't been finalized yet, such as cross-promotions with podcasters, newsletters and blogs. More info coming soon.</p>

      <p>If you happen to have other ideas or if you're missing something on this list, please get in touch: <a href="mailto: summer-of-code@railsgirls.com" title="mail to the sponsor-team">summer-of-code@railsgirls.com</a></p>

      <p>If you prefer to transfer the money directly you can use one of the following bank accounts. Please mention "RailsGirls Summer of Code" in the subject.</p>
